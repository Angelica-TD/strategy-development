Strategy
Student inputs:
Plan, how to achieve goals, priorities


Teacher input
Think about it in terms different levels.

Top level - Corporate level which is the whole organisation
Mid level - Business unit or department level
Process level - Specific to an application, may be within a department or multi-department

There will be overlaps

Strategic analysis and Enterprise analysis sit at the top level
BA sits in the mid level
System analysis sits at process level


Enterprise analysis - all about technology
Enterprise analysis and enterprise architecture are linked
Enterprise architecture looks at the solutions at a top level with the future in mind. They answer questions such as: what platform to use based on requirements, how will the solution perform in the future, etc.

All big IT companies have IT governance - which means any changes from the process level will go up to Corporate level for approval
