Business case

one of the most fundamental parts is cost-benefit analysis
other components in a business case:
- how it aligns to the company objective
- risks
- scope
- deliverables
- stakeholder analysis is not necessary for delivering the business case / what you do need is the output from the consultation with stakeholders (stakeholder requirements)
- benefits


Business case is a static document - once it's approved it can not be changed

Scope of work document - this is based on client requirement
